// Per-lemma morphological inventory: tags combinations that CAN'T exist
// in real Greek for each lemma (a "negative" inventory).
//
// Read by the parse-feedback line under YOUR PARSE on the step-by-step
// summary. When the student's picked parse violates this inventory the
// feedback says "[no morph exists]" — a confident statement that no
// such form exists in the language, not just that we lack the data for
// it. Combinations that ARE possible but aren't in our data still
// render as "—" (data gap), so this file should only enumerate
// genuine morphological gaps, never just-not-covered-yet ones.
//
// Lemmas not listed default to "all standard combinations possible."
// Add entries here as new defective lemmas show up in the paradigm
// data — keep the bar high: only mark something impossible when it
// genuinely doesn't exist in Greek, not when Duff hasn't introduced
// it yet.
