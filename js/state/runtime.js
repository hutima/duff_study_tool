// The application's mutable runtime state — every binding that used to live
// as a top-level `let` in main.js. Modules that need read or write access
// import this object directly and operate on its properties. Mutations on
// object/array properties propagate because there's a single shared
// reference; reassignments to primitive fields (e.g. `runtime.studyMode =
// 'morph'`) work because callers always go through this object.
//
// Initial values match what main.js used to declare. Anything that needs to
// be reset later (resetAllStats, restoreState) reassigns runtime.foo just
// like main.js used to reassign the bare `foo`.
